# Testing Guide for Stripe + Printify Integration

## üß™ Testing Setup

### 1. Install Stripe CLI
```bash
# Install Stripe CLI (if not already installed)
# Windows: Download from https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/releases
# Or use: winget install stripe.stripe-cli
```

### 2. Login to Stripe CLI
```bash
stripe login
```

### 3. Start Webhook Forwarding
```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhook
```

This will give you a webhook secret that starts with `whsec_...` - add this to your `.env.local` file.

### 4. Update Environment Variables
Make sure your `.env.local` contains:
```env
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_... (from stripe listen command)
PRINTIFY_API_KEY=your_actual_printify_api_key
PRINTIFY_SHOP_ID=your_actual_printify_shop_id
```

## üß™ Testing Steps

### 1. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Checkout Flow
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click "Buy Now ‚Äî $39" button
3. Should redirect to Stripe checkout
4. Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
5. Complete payment

### 3. Verify Webhook
- Check Stripe CLI terminal for webhook events
- Should see `checkout.session.completed` event
- Check server console for Printify API call logs

### 4. Verify Printify Integration
- Check Printify dashboard for new order
- Verify customer details are correct
- Confirm shipping address is populated

## üîç Debugging

### Common Issues:

1. **Webhook not receiving events**
   - Check webhook secret is correct
   - Ensure `stripe listen` is running
   - Verify endpoint URL is correct

2. **Printify API errors**
   - Check API key and Shop ID
   - Verify product IDs are correct
   - Check Printify API documentation

3. **Checkout not working**
   - Check Stripe secret key
   - Verify images exist in `/public/images/`
   - Check browser console for errors

### Logs to Check:
- Stripe CLI terminal output
- Server console logs
- Browser developer console
- Printify dashboard orders
